                        Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. Son of a gun. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.</p>

                        We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. We'll play with clouds today. There we go. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. Son of a gun. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.</p>

                    <p>Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. A beautiful little sunset. And maybe, maybe, maybe... Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. Son of a gun. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.</p>
